# nano-gpt-124m-

Implementation of a GPT-style model from scratch, following [Andrej Karpathyâ€™s nanoGPT tutorial](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt).

## ðŸ“Œ About
This repo is my project where I reimplemented the GPT-2 (124M parameter) model based on Karpathyâ€™s tutorial.  
I may extend this with my own experiments, modifications, and notes.
